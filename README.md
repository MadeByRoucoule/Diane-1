## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Neural Network: Architecture [64, 16, 10] for classifying digits 0 to 9.
- 🎨 GUI: Built with customtkinter for an intuitive and modern user experience.
- ⏳ Real-Time Training: Track progress and estimate remaining time.
- 📂 Weight Loading: Load pre-trained weights for quick evaluation.
- 🔧 Installation


## Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MadeByRoucoule/Diane-1.git
cd Diane-1
```

## 📦 Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage
Start the application:

```
